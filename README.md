🏗️ Modern Data Warehouse with ETL Pipelines (Bronze / Silver / Gold)

Welcome to my Data Warehouse Project, where I design and implement a modern data architecture using the medallion (Bronze, Silver, Gold) framework.
This project demonstrates how to build scalable, reliable, and maintainable ETL pipelines from raw data ingestion to curated analytical datasets.
